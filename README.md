# Lethanix's Blog

This is my blog where I talk about cloud, linux and software development.

The current page is using a modified version of Astro [Vitesse theme](https://github.com/kieranwv/astro-theme-vitesse) with Vue and UnoCSS; this will be gradually migrated to components using either React or Svelte, styled with Tailwind CSS.
